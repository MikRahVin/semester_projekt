            <p class="infoParagraphs2">Africa, with its vast solar resources, receives an average of 2000 kWh of solar
                radiance annually, making it an ideal location for solar energy production. Here's why solar farms are a
                promising renewable energy solution for Africa:</p>
            <ol class="infoList">
                <li class="listElement"><b>Abundant Energy Source:</b> Solar farms harness the sun's energy, which is
                    plentiful
                    and sustainable.</li>
                <li class="listElement"><b>Environmentally Friendly: </b>They produce no emissions or pollution during
                    operation, making them a green energy choice.</li>
                <li class="listElement"><b>Scalability: </b> Solar farms can be easily scaled, allowing for gradual
                    expansion
                    from small to large installations.</li>
                <li class="listElement"><b>Low Maintenance:</b> They require minimal upkeep and operate silently, adding
                    to
                    their practicality.</li>
                <li class="listElement"><b>Land Availability:</b> While solar farms need significant land, this is less
                    of an
                    issue in Africa. In 2022, the population density in Sub-Saharan Africa was approximately 48.3
                    inhabitants per square kilometer, indicating ample space for solar installations.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="infoParagraphs2">Investing in solar power can significantly reduce the energy gap between Africa
                and other continents, leveraging the continent's natural advantages to create a sustainable and
                prosperous future.
