                <h3>Education</h3>
                In Sub-Saharan Africa, the lack of access to electricity significantly impacts educational outcomes.
                <b> Less than two-thirds of children complete primary school </b>, and a staggering 90% of students
                attend schools without electricity. This limitation restricts the availability of good lighting, which
                means
                classes can only be held during daylight hours. <b>Reliable electricity would allow for extended
                    learning times</b>, providing the opportunity for classes to start earlier and end later, thus
                enhancing the
                quality of education. This would give students more time to engage with their studies and participate in
                extracurricular activities. <b> Electricity enables the use of digital tools and resources, such as
                computers and the internet, which are vital for a modern education. These tools provide access to a vast
                array of information and educational materials that can enhance learning. </b> Students can benefit from
                up-to-date textbooks, interactive learning modules, and educational videos, which are often not
                available in traditional, non-electrified classrooms.
                Better education is widely recognized as a crucial factor in reducing poverty which leads to better
                living
                standars for the people of Sub-Saharan Africa.

                <h3>Health</h3>
                The absence of electricity poses severe health risks, particularly for children. Every year, <b>nearly
                    80,000 young children unintentionally ingest kerosene from lamps, resulting in hospitalization </b>
                and the
                need for medical treatment. Alarmingly, 60% of these cases lead to chemically induced pneumonia, a
                preventable condition if safer lighting options were available through access to electricity.

                <p class="infoParagraphs">
                    Additionally, <b>the use of kerosene lamps and traditional biomass for cooking exposes families to
                        harmful
                        indoor air pollution</b>. This pollution is a leading cause of respiratory infections, chronic
                    obstructive
                    pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer. Women and children, who spend more time indoors, are
                    especially vulnerable to these health risks.

                <p class="infoParagraphs">
                    Without electricity, healthcare facilities struggle to provide essential services. <b> Many clinics
                        lack
                        refrigeration for vaccines and medicines, reliable lighting for night-time emergencies, and the
                        power
                        needed for essential medical equipment. </b> This hampers the delivery of quality healthcare and
                    increases
                    the risk of disease outbreaks and poor health outcomes.

            <p class="infoParagraphs2">Africa, with its vast solar resources, receives an average of 2000 kWh of solar
                radiance annually, making it an ideal location for solar energy production. Here's why solar farms are a
                promising renewable energy solution for Africa:</p>
            <ol class="infoList">
                <li class="listElement"><b>Abundant Energy Source:</b> Solar farms harness the sun's energy, which is
                    plentiful
                    and sustainable.</li>
                <li class="listElement"><b>Environmentally Friendly: </b>They produce no emissions or pollution during
                    operation, making them a green energy choice.</li>
                <li class="listElement"><b>Scalability: </b> Solar farms can be easily scaled, allowing for gradual
                    expansion
                    from small to large installations.</li>
                <li class="listElement"><b>Low Maintenance:</b> They require minimal upkeep and operate silently, adding
                    to
                    their practicality.</li>
                <li class="listElement"><b>Land Availability:</b> While solar farms need significant land, this is less
                    of an
                    issue in Africa. In 2022, the population density in Sub-Saharan Africa was approximately 48.3
                    inhabitants per square kilometer, indicating ample space for solar installations.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="infoParagraphs2">Investing in solar power can significantly reduce the energy gap between Africa
                and other continents, leveraging the continent's natural advantages to create a sustainable and
                prosperous future.
